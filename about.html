          I come from a non-technical background. Spending six years in the
          hospitality/service industry, I learned what it meant to communicate
          and manage high stress work environments. I also fell in love with
          food and community there. I desired a trade though, so I spent three
          years after that in high-end residential trades, I learned what
          'attention to detail' really meant. Ending that era in high-end
          cabinetry finishing, there was expectations to deliver high quality
          products in a timely fashion. This brings me to the trade of
          programming.

          Deciding upon a full stack development bootcamp took a lot of time and
          nerve. A career change with no degree isn't exactly screaming
          <i>BRILLIANT IDEA!</i><br />Having some family members in tech who
          supported and encouraged me, I decided to take the leap into
          re-skilling. And I love it! It ties into my strengths of being
          trade-like with a get out what you put in type of learning style. And
          I still get to make things, which was my favorite part of being in the
          construction industry.

        <h1>I make music.</h1>
        <p class="pFont">
          Music has been in my life since I was a child. I continue to do so
          through piano primarily, but I dabble in producing electronic music as
          well. I have hopes of publishing this music someday soon, so keep an
          eye out here for links to my creative endeavors.
