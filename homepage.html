        <h1>Development Journey</h1>
        <p class="pFont">
          Although coming from a non technical background, I have greatly
          enjoyed learning how to develop through various programming languages.
          C#/.NET for back-end, SQL for data, HTML/CSS and soon JS/TS for
          front-end development. I view programming as trade to master over a
          long life. With more to learn around every corner. Being a
          hybrid-taught musician (half self, half instructor) I have fallen in
          love with Bootcamp styler learning for programming.

        <h1>Born in Lansing, MI.&nbsp; Raised in Okemos, MI</h1>
        <p class="pFont">
          Spending 18 years in Okemos I met a lot of great friends and had
          family close by. Adolescence and young adulthood gave me a lot of
          opportunity to call that place home. In 2012, I moved to Grand Rapids.
          Ever since then, all of my siblings, their spouses and children, and
          my parents have moved to Grand Rapids as well. Giving me another city
          to call home. Meeting my wife and so many other delightful folks here
          has given me even more reason to plan on settling down in West
          Michigan.
        </p>
        <p class="pFont">Loving to travel, though. My wife and I perhaps have a couple other places out there waiting for us to call them home before too long. </p>
